# Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles for configuring my development environment on macOS and Linux. The dotfiles include configurations for tmux, starship, lazygit, neovim, and zshrc, as well as local gh config. It uses [Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) as a way of linking all dotfiles for my machines
